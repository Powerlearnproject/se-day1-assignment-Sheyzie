#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software product.

Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technological industries by enabling the creation of software applications and systeems that powers the various aspect of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: This involves the gathering and documenting of user's needs and sytem requirement
2. Design: This involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architechture and user interface.
3. Implementation: This involves the writing of codes and building the software according to the design specification
4. Testing: This involves conducting of various tests to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users and customers.
6. Maintenance: This is the process of providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall deals with the sequential approach with distict phases flowing donwards that is thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages. Hence software development is broken down into isolated phases that flows into each other. For example, in developing a software application that rate the quality of dress through pictures, the requirements are gathered from the client, after which the design of software is made to basically give like a blueprint of what the software will look like. Then, the implementation phase follows where code is wriiten based on the design (blueprint) specification. Then extensive testing of the software is carried out and the software is deployed after meeting all the required functionality. Maintaining the software comes last.

In the case of agile methodology, Iterative and incremental approach is done which focus on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change that is, multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel. This method encourage software development project that involve ongoing engagement between the development team and the project stakeholders.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: They are responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: They ensures the quality of the software by designing and executing test plans
3. Project Manager: They oversees the planning, execution and the delivery of software systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Developmnt Environments (IDEs): These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code
For example: Visual Studio, Eclipse 

Version Control System (VCS): These are software tools that for tracking changes in sourse code and coordinating work among team members.
For example: Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
Strategy: Given that change in the needs of clients cannot be avoided, it is always advisable to prepare for such eventualities by making sure that your codes are not always hardcoded giving you room to step in and make changes easily. Also it is important to comment your codes and also track the different stages of the software across the life cycle.

Tight Deadlines: The pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromise quality
Strategy: Allocates a reasonable amount of time for each projects. When the project is overwhelming, you can delegate various part amongst your team for efficiency.

Technical Dept: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical dept can impede future development effort and increase maintenace cost.
Strategy: An efficent approach to sloving a problem is paramount. Avoid the easy way route and focus on the best possible option to execute the task.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: The strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile meethodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timeline.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: This involves the process of testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: This involves the process of testing the interactions between ddifferent components or subsystems.
3. System Testig: This involves the process of testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: This is the process of testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Importance of Prompt Engineering: It helps to avoid wrong answer by making you questions clear and specific so that the AI model understands exactly whaat you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: 'Tell me about car'
Specific Prompt: 'Tell me about a Range Rover sport 2024 model'
